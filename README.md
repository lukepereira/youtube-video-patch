## Youtube video regenerator

[YouTubeâ„¢ Video Regenerator](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ecbemdelpoogolgfpfligajnmgbimjid/) is an extension for replacing deleted or unavailable videos.
Over time, many videos on YouTube become unavailable because they are deleted or become restricted. This extension replaces those videos with working ones to give users a less disrupted experience.

When viewing any page on Youtube, YVR will notice deleted videos, search for possible replacements, and then update the page content with a working video.

**There is no tracking of any user data.**

This extension is free to use, please [donate](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=SCCDZQ7E3KUR6&currency_code=CAD&source=url)!
